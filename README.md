# Capture the SOL

**Capture the SOL** is a blockchain-powered Capture the Flag (CTF) ecosystem built on **Solana**.
It combines Web3 smart contracts with a modern Web2 interface to create a fun, educational, and competitive experience for security enthusiasts and blockchain learners alike.

⚠️ Note Phantom wallet extension on the **Devnet** with a chrome browser is required :) ⚠️

## Overview

Using a **Solana smart contract** (written in **Rust** with **Anchor**), users can create and host CTF challenges directly on-chain.
Each challenge stores:

* **Bounty** — the prize for solving the challenge
* **Hashed flag** — securely stored in a derived Program Derived Address (PDA)

Anyone can attempt to solve the challenge, submit the correct flag, and instantly redeem the prize.

**Learn. Hack. Earn.**
Capture the SOL is a community-driven ecosystem for learning, experimenting, and competing in on-chain CTFs.

## Features

* On-chain challenges — CTFs deployed via Solana smart contracts
* Instant payouts — prizes automatically redeemed on success
* Community engagement — comment, tip other users, and share solutions
* Global leaderboard — compete for top hacker rankings

## Deployment

* **Smart contract:** written in Rust using Anchor and deployed to Solana Devnet

  * Program account: [9NYLcKqUvux8fz8qxpwnEveosrZS7TG6oHn1FSPLkMjt](https://solscan.io/account/9NYLcKqUvux8fz8qxpwnEveosrZS7TG6oHn1FSPLkMjt?cluster=devnet)
* **Frontend:** built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel
* **Backend:** powered by Convex

Three demo challenges are currently live on the site, with a prize for anyone who completes all three.

## Vision

Capture the SOL aims to be the go-to hub for blockchain CTFs and educational challenges.
Given more time, we plan to transition from Web2-style points to **on-chain Web3 points**, incentivizing meaningful contributions and community participation within the ecosystem.
